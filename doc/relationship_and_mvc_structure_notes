== Summary
	
	The point of this document is to help decide what will be public and what will be private in terms of user access; how we will lay this out in the controllers (read nest); and how the routes will work out. I wanted to spend a little bit of time on this as this is a public project and I don't want the code to be hard to follow. Clean from the start is the best right?
	
== Main Actors

	User:
		The user should have a public face. Whether this includes some ranking, reviews, etc, is yet to be decided. The user definitely needs it's private side, and I doubt that should be debated.
		
	Item:
		Items should be public facing, but privately controlled. Some ideas are to allow items to have options such as availability in certain time ranges, up to a certain price, or not less than a certain price, etc. Bear in mind that items represent either a good or a service.
		All items should add to a general search at least in description, and, when people are going to add new items, certain properties of the item should be rolled in to a general selection, read template type, that could be picked instead of having to recreate a name and description for generally the same type of item.
		
	Trade:
		I believe that the amount of trades a person has made should be public facing, but that the specifics of the trade could be public or private dependent on the users wishes that were involved in said trade. By default I will write all as public and we can fiddle with this as time goes on.
	
	LiveSearch:
		Live searches are absolutely private. The point of this is that a user could save a search for a specific need and as items arrive that meet his search he would be notified; either by rss, his dashboard, or even by email.
